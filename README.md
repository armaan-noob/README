Basic Details
Team Name: DUO INFUSION

Team Lead: ARMAAN BIN KARIM

Project Description
A playful, interactive AI-powered pet translator that lets users pick a pet and "translate" their sounds into fun, human-like phrases. Smooth animations, modern UI, and animal-themed magic for all ages.

The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)
Ever been frustrated because your dog‚Äôs "woof" sounded more like "let‚Äôs overthrow the government" than "I‚Äôm hungry"? Yeah‚Ä¶ neither have we.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI Pet Translator that turns your pet‚Äôs adorable noises into funny, relatable human sentences ‚Äî because we all need to know what our chicken is really thinking.
